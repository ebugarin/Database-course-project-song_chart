# Database description
I am interested in designing a database system for keeping track of all songs
that come out from artists, and the top charts of the most popular songs in
each week. I was motivated because I love listening to music and want to keep
track of all the songs and their properties and see if there are any patterns to
the top songs. A collection of songs are collected, each of which has a unique
song ID and a song name, genre of the song, number of streams, genre, artistID, album
ID of the associated song, and the BPM of the song. The artists who made
the song are also collected, each of which have a unique artist ID, name,
nationality, how many albums released, number of songs released and awards.
The albums of each artist are also collected with a unique albumId, and the
name of the album is collected with the name of the artist,
length of album, album rating, artistID and total streams from it. Each top chart
consists of an associated date of the chart, the song name, the song id, artist
name, artist ID, the BPM of the song, the genre of the song, and the weeks the
song has charted.
